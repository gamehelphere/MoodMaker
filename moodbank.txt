The past cannot be changed.
Opinions do not define your destiny.
Everyone's journey is different.
Judgements are not about you.
Overthinking will lead to sadness.
Happiness is found within.
Your thoughts affect your mood.
Smiles are contagious.
Kindess is free.
It is fine to let go and move on.
What goes around, comes around.
Things will always get better with time.
